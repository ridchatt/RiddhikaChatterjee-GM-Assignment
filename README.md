Project Name
Overview
This project uses Playwright for end-to-end testing of our web application. The tests are organized into various suites that verify different functionalities of the application. The project follows a Page Object Model (POM) approach to maintain test readability and reusability.

  Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (v6 or higher)

Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

2. Install dependencies:

npm install

3. Configuration:

Ensure you have the necessary configuration in config/config.ts and environment variables in .env. Update any base URLs or endpoints as required.

TypeScript Configuration
Ensure tsconfig.json is correctly set up. Adjust paths or settings as needed.

Running Tests

All Tests

To run all tests (both UI and API), use:
npx playwright test

Or, if you have defined scripts in package.json, you can use:
npm test

Specific Test Suites

To run specific test suites, use:
npx playwright test e2e/ui/tests/<test-file>.ts

Test Configuration
Test configurations and environment variables should be set in .env or in your environment configuration files. For example, you might have:
BASE_URL="https://demoqa.com"

Test Writing Guidelines
1) Page Object Model: Use Page Object classes in the pages directory to encapsulate interactions with UI components.
2) Test Cases: Organize test cases into appropriate files within the tests directory.
3) Data Management: Store test data in utils/data-utils.ts for easy management and reuse.

Common Commands
Run Tests with Debugging: To run tests with debug mode enabled, use:
npx playwright test --debug

Generate Test Reports: Playwright supports various reporters. Configure your preferred reporter in playwright.config.ts.

Troubleshooting
1) Issues with Test Execution: Ensure that all required services (like local servers) are running before executing tests.
2) Configuration Issues: Verify environment variables and configuration files for correctness.
